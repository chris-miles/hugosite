      <description>A while ago, I learned a numerical recipe for simulating state-dependent jump processes from this paper by Romain Veltz. After some digging, this book by Graham and Talay seems to introduce the method. Itâ€™s a cute trick that even my advisor was excited by, so I figured it seemed like a nice short thing to share.
Setup Suppose we have some switching process \(X_t\), which between jump events evolves via \[\begin{equation} \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} X_t = F(X_t).</description>
