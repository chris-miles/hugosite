      <description>In this post, I’ll discuss an idea emerging in the statistical physics community that attempts to resolve some unexplained observations of motion of single particles.1
Anomalous yet Brownian The motivation is as follows: suppose we observe two particles and keep track of their trajectory, as seen in Figure 1.

      <description>In the ever-growing list of talks I’ve suffered through, I’ve noticed a bizarre trend in many given by mathematicians considered “rockstars”: half the talk consists of rambling about old, obscure books in their field. I’m honestly not sure if this is simply because they can get away with it because they’re already famous, or because arcane tomes are a genuinely good source of information. I’m operating under the latter assumption.</description>
