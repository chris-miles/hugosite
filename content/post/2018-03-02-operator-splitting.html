<p>I stumbled across the recent paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02232">“Efficient Reactive Brownian Dynamics”</a>, which proposes a reaction-diffusion scheme based on a technique called Strang splitting. While I was vaguely familiar with the notion of splitting, I wanted to write up this post to think out some of the details I hadn’t previously.</p>
<p>The reaction-diffusion scheme is a perfect context to understand splitting because there are effectively two (coupled, but distinct) dynamics going on: diffusion and reactions. This will be the generic setup we’ll consider in this post. Suppose we have some quantity <span class="math inline">\(u(t)\)</span> that evolves by the differential equation
<span class="math display" id="eq:full">\[\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = L_1(u) + L_2(u),\tag{1}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(L_1,L_2\)</span> are two operators. While we’ll consider some specific choices of these operators, I’ll mention now that we’re not limited to just ODEs for this. That is, <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> could be a function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(L_i\)</span> could be an differential operator in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, giving us a PDE for <span class="math inline">\(u(x,t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The whole idea is then: we want to somehow solve the two problems separately. That is, we want to split <a href="#eq:full">(1)</a> into the subproblems
<span class="math display" id="eq:L1L2">\[\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial t} &amp;= L_1 (u_1)\\
\frac{\partial u_2}{\partial t} &amp;= L_2 (u_2)
\end{cases}\tag{2}
\end{equation}\]</span>
Say we were able to solve the system <a href="#eq:L1L2">(2)</a>, how do we combine <span class="math inline">\(u_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u_2\)</span> to construct the solution <span class="math inline">\(u(t)\)</span> to the full system <a href="#eq:full">(1)</a>?</p>
<div id="linearity-matrix-exponentials" class="section level2">
<h2>Linearity, Matrix exponentials</h2>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(L_1, L_2\)</span> are both <strong>linear</strong> operators, and <span class="math inline">\(u(t)\)</span> does not depend on space, so <span class="math inline">\(L_1, L_2\)</span> are just matrices. The solution to <a href="#eq:full">(1)</a> can be constructed by the matrix exponential
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    u(t) = e^{(L_1+L_2)t}u(0).
\end{equation}\]</span>
Using the same technique, we know the solutions to <a href="#eq:L1L2">(2)</a> are
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    u_1(t) = e^{L_1 t}u_1(0), \qquad u_2(t) e^{L_2 t} u_2(0).
\end{equation}\]</span>
Because we’re cooking up <span class="math inline">\(u_1,u_2\)</span> we can choose initial conditions on <span class="math inline">\(u_1, u_2\)</span> however we’d like. Say, we take <span class="math inline">\(u_1(0)u_2(0)=u(0)\)</span>. Is this enough to make the answer obvious?
If we then consider
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    u_*(t) := u_1(t)u_2(t) = e^{L_1 t} u_1(0) e^{L_2 t} u_2(0) = e^{L_1 t} e^{L_2 t} u(0),
\end{equation}\]</span>
does this give us the solution to our original problem? <strong>No!</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the properties of <em>matrix</em> exponentials tell us that (in general)
<span class="math display" id="eq:AB">\[\begin{equation}
    e^{A+B} \neq e^{A}e^{B},\tag{3}
\end{equation}\]</span>
and therefore
<span class="math display" id="eq:AB">\[\begin{equation}
    e^{L_1 t} e^{L_2 t} \neq  e^{(L_1+L_2)t}.
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="commutators-bch-formula" class="section level2">
<h2>Commutators, BCH formula</h2>
<p>Is \tag{3} ever true? That is, can we ever naively combine matrix exponentials? It turns out, the answer to this is <em>yes</em>, if <span class="math inline">\(A,B\)</span> commute. That is
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    AB = BA \qquad \leftrightarrow \qquad e^{A}e^{B} = e^{A+B}.
\end{equation}\]</span>
We’ll look at concrete examples later, but it turns out that this is pretty rare. Is all hope lost? Is there any way to recover an approximation for <span class="math inline">\(u(t)\)</span> from this technique?</p>
<p>The answer (somewhat surprisingly) comes from Lie theory, in the form of the Baker-Campell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula. To state the formula, first I must mention the <strong>commutator</strong> of two matrices <span class="math inline">\(A,B\)</span>, defined by
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    [A,B] := AB - BA.
\end{equation}\]</span>
Note that if <span class="math inline">\(A,B\)</span> commute, <span class="math inline">\([A,B] = 0\)</span>. With this, we can state the classical result.</p>
<div id="baker-campell-hausdorff-formula" class="section level3">
<h3>Baker-Campell-Hausdorff formula</h3>
<p>Consider the matrices <span class="math inline">\(A,B,C\)</span> such that
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
e^{A}e^{B} = e^{C}
\end{equation}\]</span>
then <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> can be computed by the series
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    C = A +B  + \frac{1}{2} [A,B] + \frac{1}{12}[A,[A,B]]+ \cdots.
\end{equation}\]</span>
The usefulness of this is hopefully apparent: even though our linear operators may not commute, we can take progressive terms of this series to get an approximation for the full solution to our system.</p>

<div id="splitting-techniques-errors" class="section level2">
<h2>Splitting techniques, errors</h2>
<p>We’ve discussed already the possibility of some approximations, but I just wanted to associate the names used in the literature with the explicit expressions used.</p>
<p>The most naive approximation, but also the simplest is</p>
<div id="first-order-splitting" class="section level3">
<h3>First order splitting</h3>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    e^{t(L_1+L_2)} \approx e^{tL_1} e^{tL_2}.
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>We know from the BCH formula that if <span class="math inline">\(L_1,L_2\)</span> commute, this is an <em>exact</em> technique. However, the BCH formula also provides the next approximation</p>
</div>
<div id="second-order-strang-splitting" class="section level3">
<h3>Second order (Strang) splitting</h3>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    e^{t(L_1+L_2)} \approx e^{\frac{1}{2} tL_1} e^{tL_2} e^{\frac{1}{2}t L_1}.
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>This approximation was popularized by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Strang">Gil Strang</a> and associated with his name. The perhaps more useful description of second order comes from the observation that the BCH formula actually provides error estimates
<span class="math display" id="eq:strang">\[\begin{equation}
    e^{t(L_1+L_2)} - e^{\frac{1}{2} tL_1} e^{tL_2} e^{\frac{1}{2}t L_1} \sim \mathcal{O}(h^3), \tag{4}
\end{equation}\]</span>
which describes the <em>local error</em> introduced by the approximation, and therefore the global error
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    \text{global error} = \text{(# of steps)} \times \text{(error at each step)} \sim \frac{1}{h} \times h^3 \sim \mathcal{O}(h^2),
\end{equation}\]</span>
hence the name <em>second order splitting</em>.</p>

<div id="examples" class="section level2">
<h2>Examples</h2>
<div id="advection-diffusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Advection-Diffusion</h3>
<p>In this section, I’ll discuss a few examples, most of which are taken from <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-336-numerical-methods-for-partial-differential-equations-spring-2009/lecture-notes/MIT18_336S09_lec20.pdf">these lecture notes</a>.</p>
<p>Consider the classical advection-diffusion equation
<span class="math display" id="eq:advec-diff">\[\begin{equation}
    \partial_t u = -v u_x + Du_{xx}.\tag{5}
\end{equation}\]</span>
Here, we have two clear parts, so take
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    L_1 u := -v u_x, \qquad L_2 u := Du_{xx}.
\end{equation}\]</span>
What happens when we apply splitting to this problem? Let’s use the BCH formula to see how these operators interact:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    L_1 L_2 u = -v(D u_{xx})_{x} = D (-v u_{x})_{xx} = L_2 L_1 u,
\end{equation}\]</span>
so $[L_1,L_2] =0 $. Therefore, we know that first order splitting is <em>exact</em> in this case, meaning that
<span class="math display" id="eq:advec-sol">\[\begin{equation}
    u(x,t) = e^{(L_1+L_2)t} u(0) = e^{tL_1} e^{tL_2} u_0(x). 
    \tag{6}
\end{equation}\]</span>
If we unpack <a href="#eq:advec-sol">(6)</a> a bit, we’ll find that it provides a surprisingly intuitive result. Consider the two rightmost terms: <span class="math inline">\(\exp{(t L_2)} u(0)\)</span>. We know <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> is just the pure diffusion operator, so the exponential is the solution operator (generator of the semi-group, if those words mean anything) for the heat/diffusion equation equation applied to some initial condition. Consequently,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
e^{tL_2} u_0(x) = u^\star(x,t) \quad \leftrightarrow \quad \partial_ tu^\star = D \partial_{xx} u^\star, \,\, u^\star(x,0) = u_0(x).
\end{equation}\]</span>
Now, we must apply the <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> exponential, but this is simply the solution operator for the pure advection equation applied to an initial condition, which we know produces a traveling wave solution. Consequently, we immediately have
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
e^{tL_1} u^\star(x,t) = u^\star(x-vt,t). 
\end{equation}\]</span>
While this solution can easily be obtained by a Fourier transform, the splitting technique breaks down each operator’s contribution to the full solution to <a href="#eq:advec-diff">(5)</a>, in (what I think are) intuitive parts.</p>
</div>
<div id="reaction-diffusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Reaction-Diffusion</h3>
<p>In the last example, we saw that <em>sometimes</em> operators commute and work out nicely, however this is usually not the case. I started this post by suggesting that reaction-diffusion is a natural place for splitting to arise, so let’s consider the simplest scenario of such. Consider the PDE
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\partial_t u = D \partial_{xx} u + (a-b u),
\end{equation}\]</span>
and call <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> the diffusive part and <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> the reaction (just decay in this case). We can easily check that these do not commute by comparing
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    L_1 L_2 u = -bDu_{xx} \qquad \neq \qquad L_2 L_1 u = a-bD_{uxx},
\end{equation}\]</span>
meaning this is a case where first order splitting is  exact, but we’ve established a few appropriate approximations.</p>
<p>Here, I’ll show a brief (crude) implementation of Strang splitting in R, using Crank-Nicolson for the diffusion part and forward Euler for the reaction term.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>We first just establish some preliminary constants for the simulation</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dt = .001; # step size in time
dx = .05; # step size in space
T = 1; # max time

D = 1; # diff coefficient
b = .6; # decay rate
a = 1.0; # birth rate
L = 1; # length of domain

Nt = round(T/dt) # number of time stpes
Nx = round(L/dx) # number of spatial points
x = seq(0, L, length.out=Nx+1)    # Mesh points in space
uvals = matrix(nrow=(Nx+1),ncol=(Nt+1)) # matrix of solutions

uvals[,1] = sin(pi*x/L) # just some nice initial condition that satisfies BCs</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>## reaction term  f(u) = a-bu
f &lt;- function(u, x,t){
 return (a-b*u)
}</code></pre>
<p>From there, we just need to specify how we’ll numerically solve each of the components. For the reaction, we just simply take an Euler step</p>
<pre class="r"><code># forward euler, u_{i+1} = u_i + dt*f(u_i)
rxn_step = function(u,dt){ 
  return (u + dt*f(u))
}</code></pre>
<p>For the diffusion term, things get a little more complicated, but ultimately we’re just going to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank%E2%80%93Nicolson_method">Crank-Nicolson</a>, implemented (probably poorly) below</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Construct tridiagonal matrix
tridiag &lt;- function(upper, lower, main){
    out &lt;- matrix(0,length(main),length(main))
    diag(out) &lt;- main
    indx &lt;- seq.int(length(upper))
    out[cbind(indx+1,indx)] &lt;- lower
    out[cbind(indx,indx+1)] &lt;- upper
    return(out)
} 

# Crank Nicolson, NOT including rxns because of splitting
diffusion_step = function(u,dt){
    mu = 0.5*D*dt/(dx^2); # 0.5*CFL number
    diagonal = rep(1+2*mu, Nx+1)
    lower = rep(-mu,Nx)
    upper = rep(-mu,Nx)
    
    # BCs
    diagonal[1] = 1;
    upper[1] = 0;
    diagonal[Nx+1] = 1;
    lower[Nx] = 0;
    A&lt;- tridiag(upper,lower,diagonal)    
    bb = numeric(Nx+1);
    bb[2:(Nx)] = u[2:(Nx)]+mu*(u[1:(Nx-1)] - 2*u[2:(Nx)] + u[3:(Nx+1)]);
    usol &lt;- solve(A,bb)
    return(usol)
}</code></pre>
<p>Now, we use the Strang splitting described by <a href="#eq:strang">(4)</a>, which says at each step: take <span class="math inline">\(0.5 \Delta t\)</span> of a reaction step, followed by <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span> of a diffusion step, and then finally <span class="math inline">\(0.5\Delta t\)</span> of a reaction step.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>for (i in 1:Nt){
    uold_split = uvals[,i];
    uuu_split = rxn_step(uold_split,dt/2);
    uu_split = diffusion_step(uuu_split,dt);
    u_split = rxn_step(uu_split,dt/2);
    uvals[,i+1] = u_split;
}</code></pre>
<p>Now we’ve constructed our solution, we see we get a nice plot.

A lot of improvements can be made to this code, but hopefully this conveys the barebones idea.</p>

<h2>Loose ends</h2>
<p>This post really covers only the broad strokes of splitting. We haven’t addressed some very natural questions, such as:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>if each of the split subproblems is numerically stable, is the full problem?</em></li>
<li><em>how do we split so that steady-state solutions are preserved?</em></li>
<li><em>how do we extend this to stochastic equations?</em></li>
</ol>
