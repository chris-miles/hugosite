I've recently completed my PhD in the [mathematical biology research program](http://www.math.utah.edu/research/mathbio/). Later this year, I'll start a postdoc at the [Courant Institute](http://www.cims.nyu.edu).

My research centers around using mathematics to understand how biological systems function *because* of **randomness**, rather than *in spite* of it. 

Within this realm, I have particular interests in 
<ul class="one">
<li> molecular motors and intracellular transport </li>
<li> jump-diffusion processes </li>
<li> noise in ligand-receptor signaling </li>
</ul>
