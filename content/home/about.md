I'm currently a 5th year graduate student in the [mathematical biology research program](http://www.math.utah.edu/research/mathbio/). Later this year, I'll start a postdoc at the [Courant Institute](http://www.cims.nyu.edu).

My interests center around using mathematics to understand how biological systems function *because* of **randomness**, rather than in spite of it. One such example (and my primary biological focus) is the utilization of **molecular motors.**
Work I have done in this realm includes:

1. analysis of **metastable switching** in populations of motors;
2. development of theory to study state-dependent **jump-diffusion processes**;
3. **collaboration with experimentalists** to understand motor-driven transport data.
